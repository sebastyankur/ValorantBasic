        <h1 class="titles">VALORANT JETT CHANGES FOR PATCH 4.08</h1>        
        <p>Greetings all, I’m Alexander Mistakidis, Agent designer on VALORANT, here with Agent Designer Jay Watford and Game Designer Sal Garozzo to talk about upcoming changes to Jett.</p>
        <p> When we promised more Agent updates than ever and patches have rolled in, many of you have wondered about Jett. Truth is that we have been working on Jett’s update for a while and took extra steps to make sure we were approaching the update in the best way possible. We wanted to do right for the game’s health and for Jett players. This article will share more context on why we are making these changes.</p>
        <h2>JETT POWERED</h2>
        <p>It’s crazy to think of how perception of Jett’s power has evolved from once being considered one of the weakest Agents in Beta to becoming a mainstay in most compositions. The team’s always loved what Jett brings to the roster: breaking through defenses on executions and making highlight plays with impressive mechanical skills. But some of her other impacts on the game have pushed beyond VALORANT’s core tactical cycle in worrisome ways.</p>
        <p>In 4.08, we’ll be making an update to Jett’s Tailwind to address this concern:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            1 / Tailwind
            <li>/On pressing the ability key, after a short delay Jett activates a 12 second window where she is empowered to immediately dash on next button press.</li>
            <li>/Her Tailwind charge is lost whether she dashes or the window expire, but can still be regained with two kills.</li>
        </ul>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFNOi0usz00?autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" width="570" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" title="" data-testid="undefined-iframe"></iframe>
        <p>With this update, we want to bring Jett back into that core loop by asking her to call her shots and then engage with a window of dash power to make those trademark explosive plays. This should create clear signals for other players to consider and understand that Jett made a deliberate call. Jett’s new dash will require an adjustment for players but we feel this is the best solution to balance maintaining Jett’s identity while increasing game health.</p>
        <p>We developed and tested dozens of prototypes for Jett’s dash, but they came up short. Some of them avoided having to press the dash ability button twice, but ended up being less intuitive for players despite that. Some of them felt better for Jett players, but didn’t give us confidence that it solved the game health issues we set out to fix.</p>
        <p>As players have mastered Jett, her dash has proved unhealthy to the tac cycle in a number of ways that we think are critical enough to address.</p>
        <p>Here are the key issues we found with Jett’s dash:</p>
        <p>/The dash had no prerequisite, so she always had access to her escape power with no intentional decision making. This freedom gave Jett the unintended capacity to continually take space or hold unusual ground without having to commit her ability. This play pattern is something that no other Agent could match, and allows Jett to exert an extreme amount of pressure on a match in a way that can be oppressive, especially at high MMRs or in professional play.</p>
        <p>/This lack of intentional decision making made it feel like she played outside of the tactical cycle all our other Agents adhere to. Too often, she didn’t have to leverage game sense that other Agents needed to succeed, because her reactive dash could often negate her own strategic mistakes, or the great tactical calls by her opponents.</p>
        <p>/As we talked about in the Controller Deep Dive, one of our core design philosophies is that Agents are sharp and provide both clear upsides and opportunity costs when compared to their peers. Jett's strength as both a dash-in executor on attack and holding angles with an Op—with unrestricted access to escape—provided her broad power with little downside. We want her to retain as much aggressive power on offense as possible, but reduce her defensive Op power.</p>
        <p>/Even in highly coordinated play, she's proven very difficult to strategize against, and her access to an instant escape (not to mention two on demand smoke screens) marginalized most of the tools the rest of the Agents have to deal with her.</p>
        <p>Overall, we want Jett to have her power moments and to be able to dash, but we also want viable counterplay and for Jett players to be more thoughtful when using their abilities.</p>
        <h2>WHY THIS APPROACH?</h2>
        <p>Often when we nerf an Agent, we get questions on why we couldn’t just buff the rest of the roster. Jett’s reactive power crowded out the competition for other Agents and pressured the core tactical promise of the game to a degree that we think it would be dangerous for the roster to try and match.</p>
        <p>It’s important that Agents as a group remain balanced relative to gun play and maps, in order to keep our tactical cycle healthy. Buffing other Agents against an Agent that is breaking that cycle might avoid some pain in the short term, but jeopardizes the tactical promise that we think is key to VALORANT. Simply put, our goal with balance is to maintain the game integrity and the tactical cycle.</p>
        <p>It’s not just about existing Duelist balance either, as Jett’s power also makes it more difficult to create compelling and viable alternatives for Duelist players. Also it sometimes made it hard to balance other Agents. For example, we were concerned about a Sova nerf before we shipped 4.08, since his utility is a key piece of how many of you deal with Jett in coordinated play. We found it necessary instead to update Jett’s dash ability to avoid reworking the entire game around her.</p>
        <h2>JETT AHEAD</h2>
        <p>Our hope is that these Jett changes provide a window where Jett can feel as powerful and reactive, prior to the changes, when she calls her shots correctly. We’re committed to making sure Jett can keep her unique place on the roster while giving our other Agents a bit of breathing room, while also ensuring we can protect the core tactical promise of VALORANT moving forward.</p>
        <p>As always, we’ll listen to you to make sure these changes didn’t miss the mark and make a better game for everyone. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this!</p>

            <div class="PN_Content">
                <p>SERVER UPDATES</p>
                <p>Added a new set of servers in Latin America, which should help with latency in that region
                    Scheduled to turn on not long after 4.07 is live!</p>
                    <p>WEAPON UPDATES</p>
                    <p> Bulldog and Stinger now delay firing inputs while bringing up the weapon to aim down sights (ADS)
                        Prevents you from getting burst mode accuracy improvements before they finish raising your weapon.
                        Adds a slight cost to the decision to switch to burst firing mid-combat.
                        You can still begin firing immediately while switching back to full auto/hip fire mode.</p>
                        <p>AGENT UPDATES</p>
                        <p>The VALORANT Agents have been busy with a pretty frightening problem. Explore around the Shooting Range to find out what they're up to.</p>
                        <p>STORE UPDATES</p>
                        <p>Load times for the VP purchase page should now load in a matter of seconds (previously, it would take more than thirty seconds in some instances)</p>
                        <p>SOCIAL UPDATES</p>
                        <p>Added new detections for different AFK-like behaviors in rotating game modes
                            Friendly reminder that discriminatory behavior is not tolerated in VALORANT, and if brought to our attention, we will be reviewing the incidents on a case by case basis and determining an appropriate punishment accordingly. We will also be updating our Code of Conduct to be more specific and avoid any misinterpretation. —S&PD Team</p>
                            <p>BUGS</p>
                            <p>AGENTS</p>
                            <p>Fixed a bug where Yoru could use a weapon immediately at the end of his ultimate by exploiting an unwanted interaction with ropes
                                Fixed a bug where it was possible to defuse the Spike while channeling abilities
                                Skye’s Seekers can once again break through the destructible doors on Ascent</p>
                            <p>SOCIAL</p>
                            <p>Fixed a bug where comms-restricted players could not listen to team voice chat
                                Fixed a bug where players were not always immediately removed from the game after being banned</p>
                            <p>COMPETITIVE</p>
                            <p>Fixed a bug that was causing performance bonuses to show at incorrect times</p>
                            <p>GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS</p>
                            <p>Fixed an issue where briefly tapping the “Use Spike” button to plant the Spike could cause you to end up holding the Spike instead of your last equipped weapon</p>

                <p>Agent Updates</p>
                <p>BRIMSTONE</p>
                <p>Some call him “Brimmy with the stimmy.” And while it’s been exciting to see you all leverage Brimstone’s recent Stim Beacon balance in fresh ways, we think having two stims reduced the importance of deploying it at the right moment. The changes below are our attempt to address this while still retaining Brimstone’s refined identity as a “bursty” excellence of execution.</p>
                <p>Stim Beacon</p>
                <p> Charges reduced 2 >>> 1
                    Cost increased 100 >>> 200
                </p>
                <p>GAME SYSTEM UPDATES</p>
                <p>Added the ability to import and export different crosshair settings via auto-generated codes.
                    To export and share your personal crosshair settings, go to Settings >> Crosshair tab >> click on the icon that looks like an arrow pointing up, found next to Crosshair Profile (it looks like an up arrow chilling in the middle of a bowl). Your auto-generated code will be copied to your clipboard.
                    To import crosshair settings, go to Settings >> Crosshair tab >> click on the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down next to Crosshair Profile. Input or paste the code in the provided field and click the “Import” button.
                    The crosshair preview at the top of the Settings Menu should reflect the imported settings. Make sure to give it a unique profile name!
                    Updated “Prioritize Strongest Weapon” setting
                    
                    The goal behind this setting is to allow players to traverse quickly with melee equipped and be combat-ready after using an ability or interacting with the Spike, ult orbs, etc. Two changes were made.
                    
                    Reworked 'Prioritize Strongest Weapon' setting
                    Renamed setting to Auto-Equip Prioritizes: Most Recent | Strongest
                    Updated the priority system to support weapon-like abilities (previous priority: Primary > Secondary > Melee)
                    New priority: (Ultimate & Primary) > (Secondary & Chamber Pistol) > Melee
                    Resolve priority ties by selecting the more recently equipped weapon
                    Added a new setting: Don't Auto-Equip Melee
                    Skips past the melee when finding the most recent weapon to auto-equip.
                    Prevents pulling the melee back out after channeling or casting abilities, without changing any other auto-equip behavior.
                    Note that you can still queue up 'equip' inputs (e.g., pressing '1' mid-dash to equip your primary once the dash completes). When you didn't queue up a specific equip action, the default auto-equip behavior was to pull out the most recently equipped weapon. The new settings are meant to allow you to modify that behavior based on preference.
                    
                    When considering how abilities fit in, deciding whether Jett's knives or her primary weapon is 'stronger' depends on gameplay context and your preference. How many knives do you have left? How close is the enemy? How's your aim feeling? In playtesting, we found that the best heuristic for which weapon is contextually stronger was whichever you had equipped previously.</p>
                <p>COMPETITIVE UPDATES</p>
                <p>Deterministic Map System enabled for all regions
                    As explained in Patch Notes 4.04, this rollout should increase the variety of maps in your queue based on a system we tested in the LATAM region.</p>
                <p>BUGS</p>
                <p>Competitive</p>
                <p>Fixed a bug that was causing the Leave Match button to function incorrectly for PBE players</p>
                <p>Agents</p>
                <p>Fixed issue where Sova’s Recon Bolt was destroyed by Brimstone’s Orbital Strike even if the Recon Bolt was well out of the area</p>
                <p>Social</p>
                <p>Fixed a bug where the mic icon on the scoreboard could not be interacted with after hovering over it with the mouse</p>
                <p>KNOWN ISSUES</p>
                <p>Icebox</p>
                <p>There are a handful of bug fixes prepped for Icebox, but the team ran into an issue that blocked us from shipping them right at 4.05 launch. We hope to ship these before the next patch and will list them here as soon as we do.</p>

            <button class="Show" onclick="Show(2)">Patch Note 4.04</button>
            <div class="PN_Content">
                <p>This is the start of VALORANT Episode 4 Act II, the one focused on cleaning house. It starts with the promised Yoru overhaul, a reshaping of the Controller role, and a renovation to Icebox (don’t skip that Ascent update though).</p>
                <p>The pure changes are listed below, but we have two special dev articles lined up that will dive deeper behind the changes and goals for the Controller Agent and Icebox updates. </p>
                <h2>AGENT UPDATES</h2>
                <h2>GENERAL</h2>
                <p>Improved the system used to place abilities at targeted ground locations. This update should make it easier to find valid placement locations in tight spaces. These are the abilities affected:</p>
                        <p>Omen's Shrouded Step</p>
                        <p>Viper's pit</p>
                        <p>Chamber’s Trademark and Rendez-vous</p>
                        <p>Every Killjoy ability</p>
                        <p>Yoru's Gatecrash</p>

                    <p>Shrouded Step</p>
                        <p>Cost decreased 150 >>> 100</p>
                        <p>Pre teleport delay decreased 1s >>> 0.7s</p>
                    <p>Paranoia</p>
                        <p>Added forward spawn offset, so players adjacent to Omen are not hit</p>
                <h2>BRIMSTONE</h2>
                    <p>Sky Smoke</p>
                        <p>Deploy time decreased 2 >>> 1 second</p>
                        <p>Deploy radius increased 5000 >>> 5500</p>
                        <p>Smoke height increased to match other Controllers</p>
                    <p>Stim Beacon</p>
                        <p>Now also applies a 15% speed boost in addition to RapidFire.</p>
                <h2>ASTRA</h2>
                    <p>stars</p>
                        <p>Max Stars reduced 5 >>> 4</p>
                        <p>Cooldown on retrieving a Star increased 14 >>> 25</p>
                        <p>Astra can now pick up placed Stars during the Buy Phase to refund their charge immediately.</p>
                        <p>Max distance of Star Placement increased 10000 >>> 30000 to allow her to place Stars across the furthest corners of maps.</p>
                    <p>Gravity Well</p>
                        <p>Cooldown Increased 25 >>> 45</p>

                        <p>Gravity Well no longer affects anyone fully underneath the Gravity Well.</p>
                    <p>Nova Pulse</p>
                        <p>Cooldown Increased 25 >>> 45</p>
                        <p>Nova Pulse no longer affects anyone fully underneath the Nova Pulse.</p>

                        <p>Nebula cooldowns are now sequential instead of simultaneous</p>
                        <p>Nebula size increased 410 >>> 475</p>
                    <p>Astral Form</p>
                        <p>While in Astral form, pings are no longer blocked by level geometry that Astra cannot see</p>
                        <p>Astra’s targeting ring in Astral form is reduced to one ring that reflects the now unified size of all her utility</p>
                        <p>Astra’s targeting ring no longer randomly disappears when aiming across some map locations</p>
                        <p>Increased the speed of the overlay that covers Astra’s screen when transitioning in and out of Astral form</p>
                        <p>Fixed an issue where Stars were placed slightly above the location Astra was targeting.</p>
                <h2>VIPER</h2>
                    <p>Fuel</p>
                        <p>Fuel drain increased 50% when Toxic Screen and Poison Cloud are both active.</p>
                        <p>Viper’s fuel bar now turns red when she does not have enough fuel to activate her abilities.</p>
                    <p>Toxic Screen</p>
                        <p>Cooldown after deactivating increased 6 >>> 8</p>
                        <p>Cooldown timer now starts when her smoke starts dissipating instead of when the deactivation telegraph plays.</p>
                        <p>Deactivation delay decreased 1 >>> .8</p>
                        <p>Toxic Screen now has yellow lights that indicate when it is on cooldown</p>
                        <p>Removed delay on Toxic Screen disabling when Viper is suppressed.</p>
                        <p>Added a unique VO line that plays when her smoke is disabled by suppress.</p>
                    <p>Poison Cloud</p>
                        <p>Cooldown after deactivating increased 6 >>> 8.</p>
                        <p>Cooldown timer now starts when her smoke starts dissipating instead of when the deactivation telegraph plays.</p>
                        <p>Deactivation delay decreased 1 >>> .8</p>
                        <p>Poison Orb now has a yellow light to indicate when it is on cooldown.</p>
                        <p>Removed delay on Poison Orb disabling when Viper is suppressed.</p>
                        <p>Added a unique VO line that plays when her smoke is disabled by suppress.</p>
                    <p>Snake Bite</p>
                        <p>Duration decreased 6.5 >>> 5.5</p>
                <h2>YORU</h2>
                    <p>Fakeout</p>
                        <p>Charges reduced from 2 >>> 1</p>
                        <p>Decoy HP: 150</p>
                        <p>Decoy is now a full running version of Yoru and can only be sent running forward</p>
                        <p>Right -click to place a stationary marker for the decoy</p>
                        <p>Reactivate similarly to footsteps to create the decoy that runs forward</p>
                        <p>Upon taking damage from an enemy gun, the decoy winds up, turns towards the enemy that shot it, and explodes after a short delay.</p>
                        <p>Enemies within the cone are flashed</p>
                    <p>Gatecrash</p>

                        <p>Cooldown charge refresh removed, switched back to 2-kill reset</p>
                        <p>Gatecrash can be faked by pressing F, while hovering over the beacon</p>
                        <p>Fake teleport will play audio and portal visuals as if Yoru is attempting to teleport.</p>
                        <p>Time it takes for teleport beacon has decreased 1.5 >>> 0.5 seconds</p>
                        <p>Teleport beacon’s in-game audio while traveling reduced 22.5m>>>12.5m</p>
                        <p>Teleport beacon’s speed has been increased 675 >>> 800</p>
                        <p>Upon activating a fake teleport, the beacon creates a small decal on the floor for 30 seconds to indicate location of the fake teleport</p>
                    <p>Dimensional Drift</p>
                        <p>Duration increased 8 >>> 10 seconds</p>
                        <p>Yoru is not revealed to enemies</p>
                        <p>Unequip delay time increased 0.6 >>> 1.2 seconds</p>

                <h2>MAP UPDATES</h2>
                    <h2>ASCENT</h2>
                        <p>B orb can now be taken from the lower box (previously, you had to double jump up to the box to get it)</p>
                    <h2>ICEBOX</h2>
                        <p>Doorway from Attacker spawn building near Green lane moved to the first cubby. This is to give attackers a new way to approach B Green instead of having to enter from two similar positions.</p>
                        <p>Green lane slightly widened. This is to make moving through this space more comfortable.</p>
                        <p>Pocket in Green lane near Yellow extended. This is to make angles toward B Site and Snowman more clear and readable.</p>
                        <p>Yellow container adjusted and new stack of crates added. As players have settled into Icebox we’ve noticed a lot of rounds revolve around anchoring down behind yellow during post plant situations. This change should allow Yellow to retain some power while adding more value to holding space on the actual site.</p>
                        <p>Lower container removed and geometry adjusted into a cubby facing Green. Doorway on the upper container widened and it’s position adjusted. This should allow players to better isolate fights around the site and make utility usable more meaningful.</p>
                        <p>Outer wall on B site and crane structure brought in toward the site. Narrowing the site allows for more controllers to comfortably use their utility without having to worry about gaps.</p>
                        <p>Building in Back B closed off. We want to encourage attackers to push further and hold more space. Closing off this building should allow players to better anchor themselves in Snowman. It should also better highlight using B Fence to cut off rotations.</p>
                        <p>Plant zone on B site adjusted. This change is to encourage more spike plant diversity while retaining some safer defaults to work with. You can now also plant on the bridge from kitchen to upper container as well.</p>
                        <p>Back wall in Kitchen adjusted. This change should help moving through this space feel more comfortable and allow players to more easily clear this space.</p>
                        <p>Crates added to Orange lane to block line of sight from under tube to danger.</p>
                        <p>Boiler ramp geo simplified and slightly narrowed. Smokes will now fully cover Boiler and players should find head peeks from ramp more predictable.</p>
                        <p>Cover on back A site adjusted. This change should give Defenders a little extra space to anchor on.</p>
                        <p>Head peek on attacker side pipes removed. Where Attackers can peek from on A Site can feel overwhelming. This change should allow Defenders to better isolate where threats can come from.</p>
                        <p>Doorway into A lowered to prevent foot shot on players on top of screens.</p>
                <h2>COMPETITIVE UPDATES</h2>
                    <p>Deterministic map selection follows 3 rules when picking a map, after players have been selected to play a match.</p>
                    <p>The system will look at all maps players have played over the last 5 maps for that mode.</p>
                    <p>The system will remove any maps that a player has played twice in the past 5 maps.</p>
                    <p>The system will pick the least played map.</p>
                    <p>If all maps have been removed due to the “Twice Played” rule, those maps will be added back to the pool and the least played map will be picked.</p>
                <h2>BUGS</h2>
                <h2>AGENTS</h2>

                <h2>GAME SYSTEMS</h2>
                    <p>Fixed an issue where you could tap the scroll wheel to activate the defuse audio without actually initiating a defuse.</p>
