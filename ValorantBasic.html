            <p>Valorant is a 5v5 tactical first person shooter set in the near future where each player plays as a character called an “Agent”. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. </p>

            <p>The game is based on sharp gunplay and the tactical abilities and with one life per-round. All players will start with 100 health and they can increase their health by buying either light shields and heavy shields. There are 2 main game modes, unrated and competitive, in both gamemodes, the players play as a set of agents and the first team to reach 13 points to win, but competitive has an overtime mechanic where a team must at least have a 2 point difference in the score. Spike rush and deathmatch are the 2 extra game modes. In Spike Rush, the players play as a set of agents and the first team to reach 4 points is the winner, but every round the same weapon is picked for every player in the lobby with ability orbs that gives special effects when claimed such as, Damage Amp, Health Regen, Tracer Rounds, Crippling Decay, Ultimate Ability, Combat Stim, Golden Gun, Paranoia, Weapon Upgrade and Twin Hunters. In Deathmatch, there will be a total of 12 players that will spawn with 100 health and heavy shields and random agents with abilities turned off in different places in a map and will have to kill each other until they get 40 kills or until the time runs out.</p>

            <h2>CREATIVITY IS YOUR GREATEST WEAPON</h2>
            <p>More than guns and bullets, you'll choose an Agent armed with adaptive, swift, and lethal abilities that create opportunities to let your gunplay shine. No two Agents play alike, just as no two highlight reels will look the same.</p>
            <p>There are currently eighteen agents in the game which are Astra, Breach, Brimstone, Chamber, Cypher, Jett, Kay/O, Killjoy, Neon, Omen, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, Sage, Skye, Sova, Viper, and Yoru. Each agent has four unique abilities, including one ultimate. So far, the agent abilities range from traditional utilities from realistic shooters such as flashbangs and smoke grenades but also include magical themed abilities like bringing up flame walls and bounceable arrows that can act like a radar.</p>

            <p>Currently in Valorant, there are seven different maps players do battle on.
                Each of them set in a different location on Future Earth, having different layouts and gimmicks, and more.
                Here's what you need to know about all the Valorant maps.</p>
            <h2>Ascent</h2>
            <p>Ascent was the first new map to be added since Valorant’s official release. It’s a two site map that is located in Venice, Italy. Compared to the other maps, Ascent has the most open area with a large courtyard at the center of the map.</p>
            <h2>SPLIT</h2>
            <p>Split was added as of the first day of closed beta. Its two sites are on the far left and right sides of the map with a middle area that provides high ground dominance.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
