        <p>Valorant takes the best from similar games in the genre. Pairing ability based heroes with a vault of weaponry enables the game to play in a hypercompetitive fashion. This 5 versus 5 multiplayer shooter is closest to Counter-Strike: Source in terms of gameplay with the added bonus of characters with unique abilities.</p>
        <p>There are two sides in the game – Attackers and Defenders. The Attackers’ job is to push a site where their objective is to plant the “Spike”. Like other “search and destroy” style shooters, if the Spike detonates, the attackers win the round. Their opponents – the Defenders – must stop the enemy team from planting the Spike at all costs.</p>
        <img class="main" src="Assets/basic/Beginners_Guide.jpg" alt="Beginners Basic Guide">
        <p>To win a round, teams must either wipe out their opponents, plant/defuse the spike or a combination of both. A team achieves victory after winning 13 rounds before the opposing team.</p>

        <p>Players start off with 800 credits in the initial round dubbed the “pistol round” as an introduction to the match. These initial rounds only happen twice per match, once every 13 rounds when sides switch. Over the course of the match, players will earn credits depending on their performance such as kills, plants/defuses and round wins/losses.</p>
        <p>Rounds come to an end depending on certain objectives that each team has. Attackers can only win in two ways, either by planting and detonating the Spike or by eliminating the entire defending team. On the flip side, Defenders can win in one of three ways instead. Like the Attackers, they can win by wiping out the entire enemy team or defusing the Spike after it has been planted. The third method of victory can be achieved by running out the round timer of 100 seconds.</p>
        <p>If you're coming to Valorant from any other shooter, you'll easily recognize the different types of weapons as well as how much power they’ll have in comparison to other categories of guns. Valorant has divided their guns into 6 types: sidearms, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, heavy machine guns and shotguns.</p>

            <p>Learning the economy is fundamental to understanding VALORANT. It’s the bread and butter of the tactical shooter, attributing to each and every round. It can often be the difference between winning and losing.</p>
            <p>Each kill in Valorant is worth 200 Creds, and planting the spike is worth an additional 300 Creds. 

                If your team falls into a losing streak, there is some additional money allocated for each round you consecutively</p>

            <p>Valorant is a 5v5 Game, so everyone is expected to play the game as a team and with a plan in mind, of course the plan will go along depending on the map, so whichever map you get matched up. Be expected to also fight againts opponents that also play tactically as at the end of the day, whoever has the better strats will win the game. </p>

            <p>There are 4 Roles in Valorant being Duelist, Initiator, Sentinel, and Controller. it is important to at least have each of one role in every game, but there is a five players and four roles, so it is the defining strategy and team composition to have the fifth slot to be filled, be carefull as some team composition are easily countered by the enemy composition. </p>
